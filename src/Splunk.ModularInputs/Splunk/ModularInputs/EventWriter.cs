            // that required a three chicken exorcism to arrive at this version.
            //
            // The observable problem was that the modular input would run, but no events would show up in Splunk.
            // I wrote the simplest possible modular input, that had static strings defining the scheme and events to stream,
            // and showed that it worked, provided you flushed Console.Out after writing. Then I put the XmlWriter in to produce
            // XML instead of the static strings, and found that no events showed up if the XmlWriter was writing directly
            // to Console.Out. The events would show up if you ran the script from command.exe, though, so it's something about
            // how Splunk is opening subprocesses. If I put a StringWriter in between, with the XmlWriter writing to the StringWriter,
            // and then writing the string from the StringWriter to Console.Out, that works. So I use that workaround here for each event.
            //
            // Next, calling Serialize on an XmlSerializer for the Event objects hung. I demonstrated that by putting in LogAsync calls
            // between each event, and showing that the log entry to splunkd.log right before the Serialize call shows up,
            // but the one after never does. So I ripped that out, and had Event write itself to an XmlWriter directly with a ToXml
